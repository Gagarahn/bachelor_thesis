GIF prediction sequence and hyperparameter name decipher:

L: number of layer

H: number of hidden channels

T: number of prediction frames

BF: is an optional tag for before optimal data settings. number is foreground pixel percentage. If there is no BF tag foreground pixel percentage is 24.12% and there is no dilation.

example: 

L3_H32_T80.gif    Is a sequence predicted by a model that have 3 layers, 32 hidden channels and 80 prediction frames.
L3_H32_T80.txt    Is all hyperparameters for a model that have 3 layers, 32 hidden channels and 80 prediction frames.


The GIF's seems to only load once - i would recommend to download the file for better inspection.
